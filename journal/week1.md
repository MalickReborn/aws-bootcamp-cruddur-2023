# Week 1 â€” App Containerization
For this week , we had more technicals tasks to do
We made the first steps into the main project.
i was able to create the first container images for our backend first and then our frontend side of the application using Dockerfile and manipulate several containers with docker-compose.
the second group of tasks was about configurating the application to add notifications endpoint in the backend and the frontend too.
we of course had to document the Notification endpoint in the openApi. i  quickly record the process as if i ain't had contact with flask before , i had early encounters with django framework, so i was not lost.
The aspect that provided me the main difficulties was about dealing with the databases . Even when following the instructions i had some errors and can't really figure out how to fix eat.  I  think that i have to work on this aspect of my knowledge width, databases and SQL. but for the project my work is done as i follow the instructions to troubleshoot the concerns with Postgres and dynamodb.
i had less struggle with the containers, Dockerfile or Docker-compose as i have been working with dockers for some time now. 
i am very happy being part of this bootcamp that will  give me a direction about the things i have to work on.
